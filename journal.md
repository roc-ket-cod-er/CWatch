# Journal: How I made a watch

## Day 1: 7/15: Display & Brainstorming.
Today, I spent my time thinking about the idea. I have two main challenges. First of all, power consumption. As I don't have infinite battery, the watch is going to have to be able to be super power efficient. Even after exploring solutions for a good 2ish hours, I still don't know what to do. The STM32 series seems too complicated, while the RP2040, a chip I have experience with, isn't very power efficient.

Well, atleast I have decided on a display. I sort of like this one:

It also has a built in touch sensor. I just need, now, a way to wake up the module when I need to...

Basically, I am thinking of keeping the entire thing off until the user signals that they want to check the time. When this happens, it all wakes up and serves your bidding. The only thing is, how?

### Hours: 4

## Day 2: 7/16: Power.

Before I start the PCB design, I need to find a suitable way to wake the entire thing up.

I was thinking that a button on the side would be okay, but that just doesn't seem very easy. I could maybe keep the chip on the entire time, and when it detects the right motion it could turn on, but that is bad for battery life, etc. What to do ... what to do.
